# The following libraries are required:
libglew-dev
libassimp-dev
libglm-dev
libglfw3-dev
# Graphics drivers
In order to run this program you need graphics drivers that support GLSL 1.3+ (130 and higher)
If you can not obtain them, there is another way.
Simply add a matrix invert (4x4) function in all shaders and switch shader version to 120.
